Tromegle:  Troll Strangers!
========
Tromegle started as a project through which to learn about HTTP requests and asynchronous I/O.  The idea was
to learn how to use urllib(2) and later Twisted while having a bit of fun at the expense of a few [Omegle](http://omegle.com) users, or "strangers".
It has since evolved into an unofficial API, complete with a simple client class.

###Trolling is a Art!
The nonstandard functionality of Tromegle is centered around a relatively simple [man-in-the-middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

The power of Tromegle lies in the Transmogrifier class, which allows for the conditional modification or injection of AJAX events
and, by extension, user messages.  In plain English, this means **you can modify the message a user sends to another**
as well as pass messages that only one user will see!

###Trolling gently
Sometimes it's just fun to evesdrop; internet users are often funny despite themselves.  Tromegle gives you the
tools to either observe or record conversations, or relevant portions thereof.

Getting Tromegle
========

You will need python version 2.7 or later to use Tromegle.  Tromegle 2.6 will not work because Tromegle makes extensive use
of dictionary comprehension syntax -- a feature added in python2.7.  

###Installing through pip

As of right now, the easiest way to obtain Tromegle is through pip.  Make sure pip is installed prior to running:

```pip install tromegle --user```


### Installing through Git

```git clone https://github.com/louist87/tromegle.git```

The package can then be installed withe the following commands:
```
cd tromegle
sudo python setup.py install
```

Dependencies
========
Tromegle is maintained and tested on the latest version of [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/).  It is very likely to
continue working with older versions, however.

Canonical installation instructions can be found on the above website, but the following installation steps
should work.

###Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distro)

```sudo apt-get install python-twisted```

###Windows

Download the installer from [here][download]

###Any OS with pip installed (Mac/Win/*nix)

```pip install Twisted```

###OSX

OSX has shipped with Twisted preinstalled since 2007, so Tromegle should work out-of-the-box!  If you have any trouble, you should try [this simple procedure](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#WhyamIgettingImportErrorsforTwistedsubpackagesonOSX10.5).
If that doesn't work, you can try [downloading the tarball][download] and installing it to a different `PYTHONPATH` than the default.
